# React + TypeScript + Vite Image Gallery

This application is a performance-optimized image gallery using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It showcases high-quality photos from Pexels and Unsplash APIs with a focus on performance and user experience.

## Performance Optimization Plan

Our performance optimization strategy targets the following key issues:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Optimization** 
   - Identify and prioritize LCP elements (often an image or large text block)
   - Add `fetchpriority="high"` to hero images
   - Remove render-blocking resources
   - Optimize JS execution before LCP
   - Set LCP performance budget (<2.5s on mobile)

2. **Text Compression**
   - Enable gzip/Brotli compression for all text resources
   - Properly serve compressed (.gz/.br) files from the static server
   - Verify compression via Content-Encoding headers

3. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Use production builds for performance testing
   - Ensure proper minification and tree-shaking
   - Optimize bundle splitting configuration
   - Remove source maps in production

4. **Code Reduction**
   - Eliminate unused libraries (react-router-dom, axios, react-query)
   - Implement dynamic imports for code splitting
   - Analyze bundle contents to identify bloat
   - Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives when possible

5. **Production Deployment Optimization**
   - Configure CDN and edge caching
   - Enable server compression
   - Implement long-term asset caching
   - Monitor real-user performance
   - Consider server-side rendering if needed

## Implemented Optimizations

1. **Production Build Optimization**
   - Minification and compression (Gzip/Brotli)
   - Code splitting and tree-shaking
   - Vendor chunk optimization

2. **Image Optimization**
   - WebP format usage for smaller file sizes
   - Responsive image loading with appropriate sizes
   - Properly prioritized LCP images
   - Layout shift prevention with aspect ratios

3. **React Rendering Optimization**
   - Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Virtualized grid for efficient rendering
   - Lazy loading for non-critical components

4. **Loading Performance**
   - DNS prefetching and preconnect hints
   - Preloading critical resources
   - Effective image lazy loading strategy

5. **Back/Forward Cache Compatibility**
   - Proper event listeners (pageshow instead of unload)
   - State preservation for instant navigation

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run performance` - Run performance tests and measure Core Web Vitals
- `npm run analyze` - Analyze bundle sizes

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys (see `.env.example`)
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
5. Build for production with `npm run build`
