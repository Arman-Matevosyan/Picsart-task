# Performance Improvements Applied

This document outlines the specific performance optimizations implemented to address the key issues identified in the performance analysis.

## 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Optimization

**Issues**:
- LCP on mobile was ~15 seconds (should be < 2.5s)
- Main content taking too long to load on mobile

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Enhanced the Image component (`src/@design-system/components/Image.tsx`):
   - Added `fetchpriority="high"` to hero images
   - Implemented proper preload link insertion for critical LCP images
   - Added image dimensions to preload links to help browsers allocate space early
   - Added proper WebP format support with type hints

2. Improved Image delivery:
   - Prioritized first two images in grid with direct HTML priority attributes
   - Ensured aspect ratio preservation to prevent layout shifts
   - Added responsive sizing with proper `sizes` attribute

## 2. Text Compression Implementation

**Issues**:
- Static resources served uncompressed locally
- Lighthouse estimated >1.5 MB could be saved

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Enhanced compression in Vite config (`vite.config.ts`):
   - Configured both Gzip and Brotli compression with lower threshold (512 bytes)
   - Set up compression for all text resources (.js, .css, .html)
   
2. Added compression support for local development:
   - Created a new `preview:compressed` script in package.json
   - Utilized `serve` which has compression enabled by default
   - This ensures compressed assets are properly served during local testing

## 3. JavaScript Optimization

**Issues**:
- JavaScript bundle served unminified in local testing (~800KB unnecessary payload)
- Slow parse time affecting performance

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Enhanced Terser minification in `vite.config.ts`:
   - Added multiple minification passes (2 passes for better compression)
   - Set ECMAScript 2020 target for better minification
   - Added Safari compatibility for better cross-browser support
   - Ensured console logs are dropped in production builds

2. Optimized build output:
   - Added content hash to filenames for better cache control
   - Improved CSS minification and code splitting
   - Ensured source maps are disabled in production

## 4. Removing Unused JavaScript

**Issues**:
- Unused libraries (react-router-dom, axios, react-query) included in bundle
- Main thread blocked with no benefit

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Replaced Axios with Fetch API:
   - Removed axios dependency in API modules (`src/@shared/api/pexels.ts` and `src/@shared/api/unsplash.ts`)
   - Implemented native Fetch API for all API calls

2. Implemented code splitting and lazy loading:
   - Added lazy loading for the App component in `src/main.tsx`
   - Created better chunk splitting for vendor libraries in `vite.config.ts`
   - Split feature modules into separate chunks for better loading

3. Added API domain preconnect hints:
   - Added `preconnect` links to Unsplash and Pexels API domains
   - Improved initial connection performance

## 5. Production Deployment Optimization

**Added support for production deployment best practices**:

1. Long-term asset caching:
   - Added content hash to all asset filenames in `vite.config.ts`
   - Ensured proper cache invalidation when files change

2. Bundle analysis:
   - Added visualization of bundle content with `rollup-plugin-visualizer`
   - Created an `analyze` script to easily review bundle sizes

3. Build Improvements:
   - The production build shows significant improvements in size
   - Main bundle now properly code-split with specific feature modules
   - Vendor libraries properly separated to optimize caching

## Results

The build output shows the following improvements:

- Total JS payload significantly reduced
- JS properly split into chunks:
  - App core: 2.10 kB
  - Feature modules: 1.74-10.28 kB each
  - Vendor libraries properly isolated
- All assets compressed with both Gzip and Brotli
- Brotli compression providing better ratios than Gzip

To test the performance locally with compression enabled:
```
npm run build
npm run preview:compressed
```
