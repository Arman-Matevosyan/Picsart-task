# Performance Improvements

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Picsart Gallery application to improve loading times, reduce network usage, and enhance user experience.

## Image Optimizations

### 1. Responsive Image Sizing
- Gallery thumbnails now use appropriately sized images (`photo.src.medium` instead of originals)
- First few images (above the fold) are marked as high priority with `fetchPriority="high"`
- Detail view uses properly sized images based on device width and connection speed

### 2. WebP Format Support
- Added WebP support for images to reduce file size while maintaining quality
- Implemented proper format detection for browser compatibility
- Optimized image loading with appropriate compression level parameters

### 3. Layout Shift Prevention
- Added explicit width/height attributes to all images
- Implemented aspect ratio boxes to reserve space during loading
- Enhanced skeleton loading components to match final content dimensions

### 4. Lazy Loading
- Implemented proper lazy loading for images below the fold
- Added priority loading only for critical above-the-fold content
- Improved IntersectionObserver implementation for infinite scrolling

## Code Optimization

### 1. Code Splitting Improvements
- Implemented better chunk splitting strategy for features
- Created dynamic, lazy-loaded SearchBar component
- Added profiler tools for development to identify performance bottlenecks

### 2. Compression Enhancements
- Upgraded Brotli compression settings for better text compression (level 11)
- Enhanced Gzip compression for broader browser support
- Added filters to skip already-compressed formats like images

### 3. Development Experience
- Added mock data support for faster development iterations
- Implemented development-only logging utilities
- Created configurable page sizes for development vs. production

## Monitoring & Testing

### 1. Performance Testing Scripts
- Added `npm run test:perf` for quick production build testing
- Created `npm run test:lighthouse` for automated Lighthouse analysis
- Enhanced bundle visualization with `npm run analyze`

### 2. Development Profiling
- Added React Profiler integration to identify slow renders
- Implemented performance timing utilities
- Created environment-specific configurations
